# ACCE 2025

This is the code repository for the "Accelerator-Centric Computing Ecosystem" (ACCE) course, edition 2025.

The course is part of the Master in Computer Science at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.
It aims to equip students with an in-depth understanding of accelerated computing systems. This involves discussing diverse computing architectures, including alternatives to traditional ("von Neumann") computer organization, and analyzing their different programming models and optimization techniques, developing a comprehensive understanding of the intricacies and opportunities of each presented approach.

This repository will be populated throughout the course with LAB assignments and test codes.
